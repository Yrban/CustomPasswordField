# CustomPasswordField
This is a ready to use custom secure password field with a reveal.

Minimum requirement iOS 15, macOS 12

This field is a drop in replacement for a SecureField for a password. It allows the user to switch between a secure and a viewable field by clicking the "eye". This view uses a combination of .opacity() and .focused to seemlessly switch between a SecureField and a TextField.
